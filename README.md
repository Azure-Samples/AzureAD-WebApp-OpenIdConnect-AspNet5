# Integrating Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web app

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

 Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial, and in particular the first chapters of the tutorial which show
 how to sign-in a user to a Web app using OpenIDConnect. See [1-WebApp-OIDC](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC)

 If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-aspnetcore/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
